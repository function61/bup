Choose a naming scheme for your volumes
---------------------------------------

!!! warning "Name your disks - not their content!"
	Don't use "Movies" or "Work" because with Varasto you don't need to stress about which
	disk is used for storing which type of data - your e.g. movies can span many disks. The data
	can even move between your volumes later as your needs change.

You can name your volumes anything you like - a few examples:

- Your favourite TV show characters (I used Futurama)
- "Disk A", "Disk B", ... etc.
- Disk serial number


You can rename volumes later
----------------------------

If you only have one disk or don't have a lot of disks, don't worry about this and just
use anything you like. You can rename volumes later if your needs change.

!!! tip
	While you can easily rename volumes later, if you followed our advice and named the
	subdirectory for Varasto blobs after the volume name, you need to also rename the
	subdirectory to avoid confusion. For local disks this is easy, but renaming the directory
	varies for cloud disks (for S3 it's impossible, while for Google Drive it's easy).
