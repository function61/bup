### Via FUSE filesystem

Linux users can treat all content in Varasto as if it was their local filesystem, even
when Varasto's content wouldn't fit in that computer's storage (the files will be streamed
on-demand). [Read more](../data-interfaces/network-folders/#architecture-how-does-it-work).

### Testing rig

Varasto is being tested on a server with a direct attach storage enclosure with 8 hot-swap
bays, but you could just as well run Varasto on a NAS or even on a regular computer with
internal drives.
