Windows
=======

Follow same instructions as for Linux, but there's no autostart yet (the systemd thing),
so you have to just run the .exe file directly from command line.

In the future I think we should research targeting
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)
(present since Win10) via Docker to have less moving parts.


After Varasto is started
------------------------

Now you can navigate your browser to `https://localhost/` and **hit "Help" from the menu
to reach the getting started wizard** which will help you set up everything.

(You'll have to approve the "insecure certificate" warning.)
