| Option            | User experience | Occasionally tested by us |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Docker            | high            | yes                       |
| Linux VM          | medium          | no                        |
| Native Mac binary | low             | no                        |


Use via Docker
--------------

[Docker works on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) so you may have success
using the [Linux (Docker)](linux-docker.md) instructions.


Use via Linux VM
----------------

If you decide to go via this route, then go back to [Installation](index.md) and follow
the Linux instructions.


Use natively
------------

Varasto server has native compilation to macOS, so this might work. We haven't tested it,
and we don't have service autostart on macOS, so you'll have to start the process manually
each time you start your computer.
