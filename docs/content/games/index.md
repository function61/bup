Varasto supports fetching metadata for games from [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/) for
[pretty much all platforms](https://www.igdb.com/platforms) like PC, game consoles (both
retro & modern), mobile devices etc.

Metadata includes:

- Screenshot
- YouTube video
- Links to external websites
- Publish date

Note that Varasto's also includes support for ratings for all content, so you can also rate
your games in your collection!
