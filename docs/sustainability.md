Sustainability
==============

I.e. how is this project going to make money?


Open core licensing
-------------------

The core of Varasto is and will be open source, and all the advertised features will remain free to use.

We will sell additional enterprise features, consulting and support to our customers.


Planned enterprise features
---------------------------

- High availability: run Varasto as multi-master setup so that if one node goes down,
  uptime is not affected.

- LDAP/SAML integration for centralized login

- Audit trail

- Realtime push-based data API for integrating into external systems

- Support

- Consulting, if you need help with planning Varasto architecture or any use cases where you'll be using Varasto
