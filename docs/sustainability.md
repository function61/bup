Sustainability
==============

As a user of this project, it is in your best interest that this project simply doesn't fade away.

How is this project going to make money, so that you can trust Varasto to be around?


Open core licensing
-------------------

The core of Varasto is and will be open source, and all the advertised features will remain free to use.

We will make money by:

- Selling cloud-hosted version of Varasto. Our focus is to make Varasto as easy as it can
  be to self-host, but there are many people that prefer to pay to have the hosting concerns
  be taken care of.

- Selling additional enterprise features (more on that below) under a proprietary license.


Planned enterprise features
---------------------------

- High availability: run Varasto as multi-master setup so that if one node goes down,
  uptime is not affected.

- LDAP/SAML integration for centralized login

- Audit trail

- Realtime push-based data API for integrating into external systems

- Support

- Consulting, if you need help with planning Varasto architecture or any use cases where you'll be using Varasto
